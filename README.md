# AWS CDK Stack Factory üè≠

This repo is boilerplate template for building, testing and deploying [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html) stacks and constructs in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It works by using a simple file structure to define stacks, optionally pass variables to them from JSON files and proxy commands to the [AWS CDK Toolkit cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/tools.html) from npm/yarn scripts.

This repository is a [GitHub template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), so you can quickly clone it into your own repo and start tinkering. Just hit the "Use this template" button on the [this repo's GitHub page](https://github.com/spencerbeggs/aws-cdk-stack-factory). This repo contains demo stack, construct and test files.

You can bootstrap this repository into a ready-to-deploy state with: `yarn bootstrap`.
