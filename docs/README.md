# Documentation

This repo allows you to build, test and deploy [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html) stacks and constructs in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It works by using a simple file structure to define stacks, optionally pass variables to them from JSON files and proxy commands to the [AWS CDK Toolkit cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/tools.html) from npm/yarn scripts.

- [Creating Stacks and Constructs](usage)
